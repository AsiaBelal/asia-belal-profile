Overview

Mobility for visually impaired individuals is often uncertain, filled with unseen obstacles and risks. This project introduces a Smart AI-Powered Cane, built on Arduino Mega, that combines affordability, safety, and advanced AI to empower users with independence and dignity. Beyond navigation, the system integrates environmental awareness, health monitoring, and private communication, making it a holistic solution.

Features

Obstacle & Environment Detection

Ultrasonic sensors for mid-range obstacles (walls, furniture, people).

Infrared proximity sensors for elevation changes such as stairs or curbs.

Water detection sensor to warn of slippery or wet surfaces.

AI Vision with HuskyLens

Face Recognition: Identify familiar vs. unfamiliar individuals.

Object Recognition: Detect and classify everyday items (e.g., coins).

Tag Recognition: Read QR codes for location or object information.

Line Tracking: Follow floor markings or guide paths.

Distance Estimation: Measure proximity to obstacles for safer navigation.

Connectivity & Alerts

GSM module: Real-time location tracking and emergency alerts.

Speaker system + Bluetooth AirPods: Clear voice feedback with privacy options.

Health Monitoring

Pulse, temperature, SpO₂, and GSR sensors to monitor vital signs and stress levels.

Data transmission to a mobile application for caregivers to track health and location in real time.

Design & Usability

Adjustable frame to fit users of different ages and heights.

Dual charging options: rechargeable batteries or adaptor for convenience.

Lightweight, ergonomic design for daily use.

Impact

The Smart Cane contributes to several UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):

SDG 3 – Good Health & Well-Being (health monitoring)

SDG 10 – Reduced Inequalities (accessible assistive tech)

SDG 11 – Sustainable Cities & Communities (safe, inclusive mobility)
